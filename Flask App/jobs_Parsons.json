The SO is given the name of the city/base/port and a general description of the target. The SO first attempts to collect information about the target facility without the aid of assets normally available to state- sponsored foreign intelligence Entity (FIE). His or her collection activities normally begin in advance of the arrival of the rest of the BSA team. Typical topics for collection include mission details, personnel and manning, operations, unique equipment, facility security, and constructing possible attack scenarios that could severely damage or destroy the operational capability of the organization or Installation. The data collected may not be absolutely accurate, but it provides a good representation of what an external observer may be able to gather. Due to the limited surveillance time, the SO will make assumptions, take some liberties, and begin his/her duties in the advance surveillance phases as depicted below.\u00a0Additionally, the\u00a0SO Specialist uses a variety of collection techniques to assemble a composite picture of the target facility or intelligence packet. This composite picture represents how the facility or organization appears to outside observers. This viewpoint is particularly useful when addressing exploitable vulnerabilities, potential attack paths and mechanisms, and signature control. Unlike other BSA team members, the SO specialist collects data without the benefit of \"host facility\" providers or the acknowledged presence of the BSA team. Lastly, the SO Specialist dentifies potential targets and provides a rationale for their selection. Identifies routes and methods of attack for each selected target.
