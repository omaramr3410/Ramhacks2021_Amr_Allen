This is an exciting opportunity to experience travelling to destinations around the world and protecting mission critical infrastructure.The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), Nuclear Enterprise Support Directorate (NE) performs integrated, multidisciplinary, Balanced Survivability Assessments (BSAs) that assess survivability of critical U.S. and allied national/theater mission systems, networks, architectures, infrastructures, and assets.BSA teams aim to ensure continuity to DoD missions and critical infrastructure by assessing the vulnerabilities and survivability of these infrastructure against a broad spectrum of threats including accidents, natural disasters, technological failure, information system attacks, terrorists, radio frequency weapons (RFW), sabotage, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD).In order to ensure continuity of DoD Missions and to maintain continuous operations of critical infrastructure, it is imperative to have fully functional BSA teams (1) to conduct Blue Team Assessments; (2) to provide specific SME assistance to Technical Support Projects (TSPs); (3) to provide Design Review assistance; and (4) to provide technical assistance to the Home Team.\u00a0\u00a0 The size and skillsets of each team will vary and include those required to execute each mission.\u00a0 The resource needs of each mission and/or stakeholder requests will be identified and managed by DTRA.BSA assessments include, but are not limited to, examining surveillance operations, physical security, telecommunications (e.g., video, voice and data, commercial and military), information operations (e.g., computer networks, IA tools use, operations security), structural protection and response (to include blast effects modeling and consideration of anti-terrorism/force protection standards), utility subsystems (e.g., power and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning reliability and endurance), weapons of mass destruction protection, emergency operations (e.g., emergency preparedness, fire protection, emergency response, disaster control and recovery, continuity of operations), and electromagnetic protection (e.g., electromagnetic pulse and radio frequency weapon susceptibility, lightning protection).\u00a0 The BSA mission, by necessity, is fluid and requires the teams operating within these environments to be adaptable.BSA teams may be deployed to high-threat, but permissive environments anywhere in the world.The SO Specialist\u00a0simulates the collection activities normally associated with a hostile agent operation in the local area. The SO is given the name of the city/base/port and a general description of the target. The SO first attempts to collect information about the target facility without the aid of assets normally available to state- sponsored foreign intelligence Entity (FIE). His or her collection activities normally begin in advance of the arrival of the rest of the BSA team. Typical topics for collection include mission details, personnel and manning, operations, unique equipment, facility security, and constructing possible attack scenarios that could severely damage or destroy the operational capability of the organization or Installation. The data collected may not be absolutely accurate, but it provides a good representation of what an external observer may be able to gather. Due to the limited surveillance time, the SO will make assumptions, take some liberties, and begin his/her duties in the advance surveillance phases as depicted below.\u00a0Additionally, the\u00a0SO Specialist uses a variety of collection techniques to assemble a composite picture of the target facility or intelligence packet. This composite picture represents how the facility or organization appears to outside observers. This viewpoint is particularly useful when addressing exploitable vulnerabilities, potential attack paths and mechanisms, and signature control. Unlike other BSA team members, the SO specialist collects data without the benefit of \"host facility\" providers or the acknowledged presence of the BSA team. Lastly, the SO Specialist dentifies potential targets and provides a rationale for their selection. Identifies routes and methods of attack for each selected target. Required Skills/Qualifications:10 years experience in DoD Special Forces (US Navy SEAL, US Army Special Forces, US Army Ranger, or Marine Corps Special Forces).Expert in identifying and targeting mission critical systems to include:\u00a0 critical telecommunications systems and supporting infrastructure; IT networks; operational command and control platform both ground and air based; mission critical utilities systems; and security systems.Expert in the planning and executing of attack scenarios designed to destroy or severely degrade the above mentioned mission critical systems.Expert understanding of the tools essential in carrying out undetected surveillance operations.Expert in current methods of conducting undetected surveillance and counter-surveillance detection tactics, techniques and procedures.Must have an Active Top Secret Clearance with SCI Eligibility.Must be able to obtain, maintain and/or currently possess a security clearance."}, {"name": "Physical Security (PS) Specialist", "link": "https://jobs.parsons.com/job/13955058/physical-security-ps-specialist-fort-belvoir-va/", "job_info": "Minimum Clearance Required to Start:Top Secret SCIJob Description:Parsons Corporation is seeking candidates to join a highly successful team that has won and performed over $100 Million of Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) work around the world for more than 20 years.\u00a0 This challenging and exciting work will provide you the opportunity to travel CONUS and OCONUS to the most important DoD defense systems and critical infrastructure to ensure the survivability of any threat or attack.
